# Make Change Project

## Description
This is my very first Java project while at Skill Distillery. I have created a very basic cash register. After opening the file, you will be prompted whether or not you are ready to checkout. If you are ready, then you will type 1 and hit the enter key. Otherwise, if you hit 2, the program will output a farewell greeting letting you know to restart the program when you are ready to checkout. Once you are ready to checkout, the program will ask you for the amount of the price of the item you wish to purchase followed by the amount that you will pay the cashier. Once you have entered the amount that you will be paying the cashier, the program will output the change due to you after purchase. The change will be displayed in normal dollar and cent format ($0.0) along with the amount of each denomination you will receive back from the cashier. You will then be prompted to decide whether you would like to purchase another item. If you select 'y' you will go through the process again. If you select 'n' the program will quit and output a thank you and goodbye message. Additionally, I have programed into the code, the functionality to determine if you have paid too little or exactly the right amount. If you have paid too little, the program will tell you that you do not have enough and to come back when you do and exit the program. If you pay with exact change, the program will notify you of this and that you will not be getting any change back.

## What I learned
This project helped me to understand more deeply, if/else statements. Especially nested statements. I also learned that %.2f is very helpful for converting a long decimal into a 2 decimal place monetary format. Overall, I feel that with this project I have become even more confident in the beginning lessons taught to us at Skill Distillery.
